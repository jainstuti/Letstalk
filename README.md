# Letstalk
A video conferencing web app built using webRTC, peerJS, socket.io, nodeJS, HTML, CSS and bootstrap
This webapp supports video call between two peers and text chat among multiple peers.

In this app, we can do the following:
1. Mute/unmute our audio
2. Switch our video on/off
3. Share our screen with the remote peer and the remote peer could also share their screen simultaneously
4. Blur our background, in case our room is messed up :P
5. Record the meeting/screen and can play as well as download it
6. Disconnect from the video call without disconnecting from the text chatting
7. Text chat could be started before the video call begins, persists during the video call and constinues after the call is ended
