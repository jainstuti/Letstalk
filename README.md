# Let's Talk
A video conferencing web app built using webRTC, peerJS, socket.io, nodeJS, expressJS, bodypix model of tensorflow, HTML, CSS and bootstrap.
This webapp supports video call between two peers and text chat among multiple peers.

In this app, we can do the following:
1. Share our screen with the remote peer and the remote peer could also share their screen simultaneously
2. Blur our background, in case our room is messed up :P
3. Record the meeting/screen and can play as well as download it
4. Text chat could be started before the video call begins, persists during the video call and continues after the call is ended
5. Mute/unmute our audio
6. Switch our video on/off
7. Disconnect from the video call without disconnecting from the text chatting


I built it using the agile methodology of first delivering the minimum viable product and then improving and adding more features and fixing bugs, if any.
